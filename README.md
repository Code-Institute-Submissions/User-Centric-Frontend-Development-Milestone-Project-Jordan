# Milestone Project 1

[Live website.](https://jordanmilliken.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project-Jordan/)
 

- This responsive website was created for Brian Milliken Production Sound Mixer, Brian is a real Sound mixer and works on many large scale productions. 
- This project was created as my Milestone 1 Project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Program.
- This website was built with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.
- Brianâ€™s website showcases all of Brians attributes and characteristics in a sleek and user-friendly manner.

The website's Carousel and jumbotron is consistent and engaging throughout all of the websites pages. The website includes a Home page with image carousel that draws the user in. An About page which is the main goal of the site to sell Brian. An equipment page where users can easily see what Brian is working with without too much text. A fun credits page with a spotify playlist embedded encouraging users to stay longer and listen to music whilst reading Brians Credits. And finally a contact page where users can get in touch and potentially book Brian for the next Job
